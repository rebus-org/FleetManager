<h1>Data Protection</h1>

<p>
    At rebus.fm, we care about data protection and your rights
    as a user, and we want to do everything as transparently as possible.
</p>

<p>
    This document describes how we handle data in Fleet Manager (FM) and
    thus how we adhere to
    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a>
    as well as other laws.
</p>

<p>
    In this document, the concepts "Data Controller" and "Data Processor"
    are used with the meaning as <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors/">defined in GDPR</a>.
</p>

<p>
    To contact rebus.fm regarding Data Protection, please direct
    emails to: <a href="mailto:mogens@rebus.fm"><code>mogens@rebus.fm</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        If something is not entirely clear, and/or if you believe there might 
        be a problem in relation to any kind of legislation in the country
        you are in, please get in touch with rebus.fm, and we will make the
        necessary adjustments.
    </strong>

<h2>Types of Data</h2>

<p>
    All data in FM falls into either of two categories:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Personal Data</li>
        <li>Event Data</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    <strong>Personal Data</strong> is the data required for you, as a user,
    to be signed up to FM. It consists of nothing more than
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a random user ID</li>
    <li>your email address</li>
    <li>a salted and hashed password</li>
    <li>which accounts in FM you can access</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Event Data</strong> is the technical data forwarded to FM by
    Rebus endpoints. It can generally be divided into
</p>

<ul>
    <li>technical data (IDs, metrics, etc.)</li>
    <li>payload data (message bodies and saga snapshots)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As the <strong>technical data</strong> only describes various technical
    aspects of message processing, it is not capable of carrying personal 
    information.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>payload data</strong> however, _can be anything_, as its
    contents are defined by the YOU, as the user of FM, because FM basically accepts
    this data without knowing what it is.
</p>


<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>
    In relation to your <strong>Personal Data</strong>, rebus.fm acts
    as a "Data Controller".
</p>

<p>
    In relation to <strong>Event Data</strong>, rebus.fm is a "Data Processor" 
    and YOU (as the legal entity operating FM) are the "Data Controller".
</p>



<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>

<p>
    The aforementioned Personal Data is stored solely to be able to allow
    users to log in to FM and be authorized to work with specific accounts.
</p>

<p>
    You, as a user, can get in touch with rebus.fm anytime and have the data
    we have registered about you

    </p><ul>
        <li>delivered to your email address (either in plain text or machine-readable form)</li>
        <li>corrected, should you have encountered inaccurate information</li>
        <li>irreversibly deleted</li>
    </ul>

    within 48 hours after receiving your request.
<p></p>



<h3>Event Data</h3>

<p>
    As FM has no way of knowing the contents of the <strong>payload data</strong>
    sent to it, YOU as a user assume full responsibility of the data sent
    to FM.
</p>

<p>
    Should you, as the "Data Controller" be required to comply with YOUR subjects'
    requests regarding THEIR data, rebus.fm can help by having all of your
    <strong>Event Data</strong> within a specific account

    </p><ul>
        <li>delivered to you in machine-readable form</li>
        <li>irreversibly deleted</li>
    </ul>

    within 48 hours after receiving your request.
<p></p>
